Utility scripts to check the status of the machine where Abiquo is installed.

== Usage

=== Abiquo server check state

  Checks the configuration of the machine where the server is installed:

    $ ./abiquoServerCheckState.sh

=== Abiquo node info collector

  Checks the configuration of the nodes that will be managed by Abiquo. 
  Uses the same code that the application and it must be ran from the server machine:

    $ ./abiquoNodeInfoCollector.sh IP_ADD_1 IP_ADD_2 IP_ADD_3 ...

=== Abiquo node check state

  Checks the state of the nodes that will be managed by the Abiquo AIM.
  It must be ran in the node itself:

    $ ./abiquoNodeCheckState.py

The Abiquo's default installation directory is /opt/abiquo but this setting can be overrided
exporting the system variable ABIQUO_HOME, i.e:

    $ ABIQUO_HOME=/usr/local/abiquo ./abiquoServerCheckState.sh
